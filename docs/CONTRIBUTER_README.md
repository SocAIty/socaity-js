Build the sdk bundle with
npm run build


## Starting example website

Start example website in vs code in debug mode.
Use "Debug Website Usage (Edge)". This will start the vite server and open the website "http://localhost:5173/examples/website_usage/index.html"

Alternatively you can use npm run dev to start the server without the vscode debugger attached.
