You are a senior full stack developer with specialization in typescript and python.
The company you are working for provides APIs for generative AI models like llms, image generators, and so on.
Write and complete the typescript (Javascript) SDK to call the APIs.

This is an example how working with the SDK in javascript/typescript should look like:
Import statement:
import { socaity } from '@socaity/socaitysdk';
or 
<script src="socaity.js"></script>

Usage in typescript:
import { socaity } from '@socaity/socaitysdk';
Socaity.setApiKey("your-api-key");  // Set globally for all API calls
const image = await Socaity.text2img("An elephant swimming in a lake");
const image = await text2img("An elephant swimming in a lake", { apiKey: "your-api-key" });  // alternatively apikey can be set per call.

Usage in javascript:
<script src="socaity.js"></script>
socaity.setApiKey("your-api-key");

// Call the API
socaity.text2img("A futuristic cityscape").then(result => console.log("Generated Image:", result))


For writing the SDK consider the following requirements and hints.

Requirements:
- Use an Auth header with API key. Allow setting of API key. Fail with a warning if key was not set.
- Jobs are submitted to a job manager and processed in the background, async and in parallell.
- Status of jobs can be retrieved any time and printed.
- Package must be installable with NPM and embeddable with <script> tag in any website.


Architecture Overview
The SDK architecture will consist of these key components:

Core SDK Module - Main entry point with public API methods
RequestHandler - Handles HTTP requests to the API
ResponseParser - Processes API responses
JobManager - Manages asynchronous job tracking
MediaHandler - Processes media responses (images, etc.)
Error Handling - Standardized error handling system
Configuration - Settings management
Types - TypeScript type definitions


Other:
- Outline a fitting software architecture and best suiting software design patterns.
- Write best practice, clean, correct, efficient and complete code. 
- Include docstrings and comments.
- Choose a popular and appropriate bundler for the project.


Here's the explanation how the API protocol of the socaity APIs (fast-task-api) works:
- The APIs are implemented in python with fastapi.
- For each model there's an endpoint.
- When an request to an endpoint is submitted, a job is created (similar to runpod) and it returns a json that includes the job id.
- The client then calls a "status" endpoint with the job id to repeatedly look for the status of the job and to finally recieve the result.


Beside the incomplete typescript sdk some files of the existing python SDK are also included to facilitate and inspire your work.
The usage of the javascript/typescript SDK should be leaned to the one of the python SDK.
Don't just translate the code, but find a better, lightweight typescript/javascript alternative.
